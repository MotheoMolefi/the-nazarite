# the-nazarite
A pixel-art action prototype built in LOVE2D, inspired by the biblical story of Samson. Step into the sandals of the Nazarite ordained by God and relive his battle against 1,000 Philistinesâ€”armed only with the jawbone of a donkey. Designed with modular architecture and dynamic directional animations. A biblical account, pixelated for His Glory!
